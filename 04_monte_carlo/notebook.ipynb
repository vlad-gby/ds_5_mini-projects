    "Scenario:\n",
    "You want to decide if opening a small pizza shop in Bergamo is financially viable. You decide to run a Monte Carlo simulation to model one year (365 days) of profit. Profit depends on several random variables: the number of customers each day and the variable cost of ingredients per customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a 1D array daily_customers for 365 days. The number of customers per day should be random integers between 50 and 150.\n",
    "Create a 1D array cost_per_customer. This should be drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of €8.50 and a standard deviation of €1.50.\n",
    "Assume a fixed price per customer of €17.00 and fixed overhead costs (rent, etc.) of €150 per day.\n",
    "Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the daily revenue, daily variable costs, and then the daily profit.\n",
    "Calculate the cumulative_profit over the year.\n",
    "Find the average_daily_profit and the total_profit for the year.\n",
    "Determine the number of days the shop was profitable (profit > 0).\n",
    "Find the worst_day_loss and best_day_profit.\n",
    "Using np.where, create a \"performance\" array where days with profit > €500 are labeled 2 (great), days with profit between €0 and €500 are labeled 1 (good), and days with a loss are labeled 0 (bad).\n",
    "Save the daily_profit and cumulative_profit arrays to a single compressed .npz file.\n",
